		/* First and Last Digit Sum
Write a program to find sum of first and last digit
The program needs to find the first and the last digit of number, using a loop and print the sum of the first and the last digit of that number.
If the number is negative than the program needs to print "Invalid value"
Example output:
252    Should print 4, the first digit is 2 and the last is 2 which gives us 2+2 and the sum is 4
257    should print 9, the first digit is 2 and the last is 7 which gives us 2+7 and ht sum is 9
-10    sould print "Invalid value",  since number is negative and needs to be positive*/
